shield_db.py — Storage layer for vault data

This module is the lowest layer in the system. It handles all reading
and writing to disk and exposes three domain-specific storage classes
that the rest of the system interacts with. Nothing above this layer
touches the filesystem directly.

Architecture:
    JSONFile    — generic file I/O. No domain knowledge.
    VaultMeta   — master password hash storage. One record only.
    VaultData   — credential record storage. List of Credential objects.
    Attempts    — failed login attempt and lockout state storage.

All data is persisted as JSON inside a 'database/' subdirectory relative
to this file. The directory is created automatically on import if it does
not exist.

Storage files:
    vault_meta.json  — {"master_password_hash": "<sha256_hex>"}
    vault_data.json  — [{"credential_id": ..., "service_name": ..., ...}, ...]
    attempts.json    — {"failed_count": 0, "locked_until": null}
